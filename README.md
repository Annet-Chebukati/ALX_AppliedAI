# [Applied AI Program](https://www.alxappliedai.com/about/)

Welcome to my repository for the Applied AI Program, a pioneering initiative designed by ALX.

## About the Program

- This program was developed with a clear vision: to make AI accessible and understandable to everyone, regardless of their background in coding. Recognizing the transformative impact of AI across all sectors, from healthcare to finance and beyond, Kalkidan and Julien saw the need to cultivate a generation of professionals who are not only conversant in AI but also capable of driving innovation in this dynamic field.
- The Applied AI Program is tailored to achieve this goal by offering a comprehensive learning journey through weekly projects, written tutorials, and video guides equipping you with the knowledge and skills to be a future innovator, problem solver, and industry leader.
