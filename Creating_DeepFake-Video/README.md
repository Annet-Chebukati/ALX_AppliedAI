# Creating a Deep Fake Video with Refacer

## Introduction
Welcome to the fascinating world of deepfake technology, powered by advancements in AI. While creating unique content has become more accessible, it's crucial to use this technology responsibly. This README guides you through the process of creating a deepfake video using free AI tools. I embarked on this adventure with the captivating trailer of the docuseries 'African Queens' from Netflix, which tells the story of the warrior Queen Njinga of Angola. In a twist of digital magic, I replaced Queen Njinga's face with my own!

## Tool: Refacer
To facilitate the deepfake creation process, I used a tool called Refacer, which you can check out on [GitHub.](https://github.com/xaviviro/refacer?ref=alxappliedai.com) This tool allows you to create deepfakes with multiple faces with just one click! It's powered by the excellent [Insightface](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface?ref=alxappliedai.com) and inspired by [Roop](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop?ref=alxappliedai.com).

## Accessing Refacer through Google Colab
You can access Refacer through Google Colab by following this link: [`refacer_colab.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gyhEp2WDvFhPJ5YthN2W0XccU700TSJv?usp=sharing&ref=alxappliedai.com). To initiate the installation and setup process, click the play button on the Refacer Colab notebook.

## Accessing Refacer Webapp
Upon completion, the program provides a link to access the application used for deep clone creation. This is a temporary link that you can use to access Refacer on the web.

## Using the Refacer Webapp
The Refacer web application comprises four main sections:
1. **Original Video Upload**: Here, you upload the source video.
2. **Target Faces Placement**: In this section, you place the faces in the video that you want to replace. Up to five faces are supported.
3. **Replacement Faces Placement**: Here, you position the faces that will replace the corresponding faces uploaded in the previous section.
4. **Output File Display**: The resulting file will be displayed here.

## Creating the Deepfake
Upload the respective files to their designated sections and click "Reface" (the big orange button at the bottom of the page). This action initiates a process that will "reface" all frames in the video using the provided faces. Please note that this process may take some time.

## Accessing the Output File
The output file is accessible on the Refacer web app. However, if the video does not appear promptly, check the Colab file for a completion message indicating the location of the refaced video. You can access the file explorer to retrieve the refaced video.

## Output Video

You can watch the output video of the deepfake [here](https://youtu.be/0mOdxJeZ0mU). It's truly amazing to see the transformation! The link provides a side-by-side comparison of the original (on the left) and my deepfake version (on the right).
