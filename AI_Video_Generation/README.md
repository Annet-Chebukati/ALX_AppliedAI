# From Text/Image to Moving Pictures - An Intro to AI Video Generation

## Introduction

As an avid explorer of the digital frontier, I embarked on a thrilling adventure—**AI Video Generation**. In this captivating project, I harnessed the power of neural networks to transform mere text into moving pictures. Let me take you behind the scenes and share how I wove magic into every frame.

## Unleashing the Animation Revolution

Imagine this: **from whispers of text**, entire worlds emerge. Characters stretch their limbs, landscapes ripple, and emotions dance across the screen. This isn't just about pixels; it's about storytelling—the ancient art that binds humanity.

I didn't need a wizard's wand or a 3D guru's expertise. Instead, I wielded AI tools, like **Pika Labs**, as my digital brushes. With each stroke, I painted scenes that pulsed with life.

To use Pika Labs text-to-video generating tool using Discord. [Pika Labs Discord Bot](http://discord.gg/pika) currently supports text and images as input for video generation, and private generations by directly messaging the bot.

To generate a video I used the "**generate-room-#**" channels.

I used the following commands:
  1. To generate videos with **Text Prompts**: use `/create`, follow the prompt to enter "prompt" and hit enter. This prompt has the following structure: /create prompt: + description of the video you want to create + optional parameters
  2. To generate videos with **Image**: use `/animate`, Enter the command `/animate` and a prompt will appear to allow you to upload your image. Once it finishes uploading press enter!
